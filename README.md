# PongGameUnity

A pong game made with unity 5.6

## Build:

- clone the repo to your pc
- open your unity and navigate to the directory
- Build the game

## Notes:

I used c# to create the scripts for this game, the game was done following brackeys 2d game tutorial on
youtube, found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h-z0AyG42k&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4_IYZY2V0G3IUYcx1zZkJe

Although it is a great tutorial, it is out of date - and done in js. If you are looking for an up to
date version that is also in c#, you can use this one - or any other you find :)
